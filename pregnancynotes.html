        <h1>Pregnancy: A Journey of Life</h1>
        <hr>

        <p><strong class="highlight">P</strong>regnancy is a natural process through which a new life develops inside a woman's womb.<br><br>
            It is a period that lasts about 40 weeks, beginning from the first day of the last 
            <a title="Look up: menstrual cycle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle">menstrual cycle</a> to the birth of the baby.
            This remarkable journey is not only a biological event but also an emotional, psychological, and social experience for expectant mothers and their families.
        </p>

        <h3>Stages of Pregnancy</h3>
        <p>Pregnancy is divided into <em>three</em> trimesters:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong><a title="Look up: Trimester" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimester">First Trimester (0 - 12 weeks):</a></strong> This is the early stage when fertilization and implantation occur. Major organs of the baby begin to form. Mothers may experience symptoms like morning sickness, fatigue, and mood swings.</li>
            <li><strong>Second Trimester (13 - 27 weeks):</strong> Often considered the most comfortable phase, mothers feel the baby's first movements (quickening). The baby's features become more defined, and vital organs continue to develop.</li>
            <li><strong>Third Trimester (28 - 40 weeks):</strong> The baby grows rapidly and prepares for birth. Mothers may experience back pain, swelling, and difficulty sleeping due to the growing belly. Labor signs begin to appear toward the end of this period.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>

        <h3>Importance of Antenatal Care</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>What is antenatal and antenatal care?</strong><br>
            Antenatal refers to the period before childbirth, while antenatal care (also known as prenatal care) is the healthcare a pregnant person receives from a healthcare professional, starting from when they confirm their pregnancy until the baby's birth.<br><br>
            Regular antenatal (prenatal) checkups are essential to ensure the health of both mother and baby. Doctors monitor growth, blood pressure, and perform necessary scans. Supplements like folic acid and iron are recommended to prevent complications. Vaccinations and lifestyle guidance also play an important role in safe pregnancy.

        <h3>Nutrition and Lifestyle</h3>
        <p>
            A <a title="Look up: Balanced diet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet">balanced diet</a> rich in proteins, vitamins, minerals, and hydration is crucial during pregnancy. Foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and lean proteins provide essential nutrients. Pregnant women are advised to avoid alcohol, smoking, and excessive caffeine. Gentle exercises, such as walking and prenatal yoga, help maintain health and reduce stress.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Childbirth and Beyond</h3>
        <p>
            When the pregnancy reaches full term, labor begins. Childbirth can occur naturally (vaginal birth) or through medical procedures like cesarean section. After birth, postpartum care is important for recovery, breastfeeding, and adjusting to motherhood.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Pregnancy is a transformative experience that requires care, patience, and support. With proper medical attention, a healthy lifestyle, and emotional well-being, most mothers can enjoy a safe and fulfilling journey to motherhood.
